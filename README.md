This is a project that I have created for my year 12 digital technologies class. This project will be submitted for the standards 91896 and 91897.


Purpose: The purpose of this project is to create a proof of concept for a game. The purpose of the game is to be an homage to old RPGs (Role-Playing Games), as well as to be an introduction to the older generation of CRPGs (Computer Role-Playing Games) for people new to the genre. To this end the proof of concept for this game must be accessible, entertaining, and a faithful recreation of the genre.


End Users: The end users this project is designed for are: People who are already interested in older CRPGs, and people who wish to get started in the genre, but want something simple and with more modern conventions of the RPG genre, as jumping straight into the classics, such as Fallout 1 and Planescape: Torment, can be daunting and confusing for modern players.


Scope: This project must be completed by September 25th (the Sunday after term 3 ends). This means that the project should be completed by September 18th, allowing for one week for the files to be distributed to a group of testers who will provide feedback and allow me to iron out any bugs or oversights that they find when playing with the game.


Requirements: For this project to be accesible, entertaining, and faithful recreation of the CRPG genre, it needs a few things:

For this project to be accessible it must include tutorials explaining not only the key mapping in the game, but also the game mechanics.

For this project to be faithful to the original genre it must feature the following: A combat system, a player inventory, a selection of character attributes (such as the 6 attributes of Dungeons and Dragons), and a way for the player to interact with the game world.

For this project to be entertaining to the target end users, it should be a faithful recreation of the genre, with the features described above. This is because those end users will enjoy the game if it is designed to fit within the game genre that they enjoy.


Resources: I have until September 25th to complete this project. I will be creating the scripts for this project using the visual studio code editor and C#. I will also use the game engine "Unity" to create this project, and Photoshop to create the sprites for this project.
