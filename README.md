This is a project that I have created for my year 12 digital technologies class. This project will be submitted for the standards 91896 and 91897.

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to create a proof of concept for a game. The purpose of the game is to be an homage to old RPGs (Role-Playing Games), as well as to be an introduction to the older generation of CRPGs (Computer Role-Playing Games) for people new to the genre. To this end the proof of concept for this game must be accessible, entertaining, and a genuine representation of the genre.

End Users: The end users this program is designed for are people who are already interested in older CRPGs, or people who wish to get started in the genre, but want something simple and with more modern conventions of the RPG genre, as jumping straight into the classics, such as fallout 1 and planescape torment, can bee daunting and confusing for modern players.
